# Overstock-Shop-POS
This program was a final project for my 1st year of CAPE examinations in Highschool. The program resembles a basic Point of Sale system but operates in the terminal.

DEFINITION OF PROBLEM
BACKGROUND
Overstock Shop owned and operated by Kim and her family is a corner shop established and 
registered in 2019. Since its establishment, Overstock Shop has served as one of the major 
providers in the McNeil Boulevard vicinity in Central Village, St Catherine. This simple corner 
shop was made to provide a quick and easy solution for people’s food and other household needs 
and as well as saving them the money they would need to travel to the nearest supermarket in 
Spanish Town.
PROBLEM CONTEXT
This family operated business operates daily using books to log information about sales and 
calculators to do the calculations. To order, a customer would come up to the counter and shout 
out the items they want to the shopkeeper. As the items are brought to the counter one after 
another, simple calculations are done to update the customer with their total cost so that they 
may determine if anything else is within their budgets. At the end of the day earnings are counted 
by just taking whatever cash is seen in the cash box and counting it. The total is placed in a large 
notebook and stored away for use at the end of the week. In regards to their items, these are 
counted manually and if the stock has been expended, they are replenished. 

DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM 
• Issue 1: Current shop system is inefficient and there is often a crowd waiting out at the 
front due to calculations being done in the head and thinking of price for items.
• Issue 2: Manual counting of stocks which isn’t always accurate and may cause the loss of 
a sale due to a lack of the item. 
• Issue 3: Owner is unable to balance the money counted at the end of the day with the total 
cost of the goods sold because no logging is taken of each sale.
• Issue 4: Keeping track of the stocks they have is don’t in an inefficient method as owners 
will not know if an item is out until they see that it is out. 
• Issue 5: No receipt is printed to show what was bought
• Issue 6: Outdated method to log the final earning for the day in a book.
